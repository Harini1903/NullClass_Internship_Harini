Project 1: Activation Map Visualization for Emotion Detection Using CNN
1. Introduction
The goal of this project was to visualize the internal feature maps (activation maps) of a CNN trained for facial emotion recognition. This improves interpretability and transparency of deep learning models.
2. Problem Statement
CNNs are powerful but often operate as black boxes. To build trust in AI, we visualized which parts of the face the CNN uses to detect emotions.
3. Tools and Technologies Used
Python 3.10, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
4. Dataset Used
Grayscale facial images (48x48), 7 classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
5. Implementation Workflow
CNN model built and trained → Saved (JSON, H5) → Intermediate layer outputs extracted → Visualized using matplotlib
6. Challenges
Initialization, shape mismatch, and file errors were resolved through proper layer usage and debugging.
7. Key Learnings
Understood CNN internals, improved interpretability with visualization
8. Future Scope
Use Grad-CAM, deploy on mobile
9. Conclusion
This project enhanced the explainability of CNN emotion detectors.


Project 2: Real-Time Drowsiness and Age Detection Using Deep Learning
1. Introduction
Real-time application for drowsiness and age detection useful in safety monitoring for drivers and workers.
2. Problem Statement
Drowsy driving causes accidents. Real-time detection is critical.
3. Tools and Technologies Used
Python 3.10, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Tkinter, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda
4. Dataset Used
Drowsiness Dataset: 48,000 images; Age Dataset: UTKFace from Kaggle
5. Implementation Workflow
Data preprocessing → CNN training for eye state and age → Webcam stream processed → Tkinter GUI summary
6. Challenges
Imbalanced data, real-time latency, model load errors
7. Key Learnings
Integrated two models, GUI and webcam in a real-time setting
8. Future Scope
Add emotion detection, deploy on embedded systems
9. Conclusion
Successfully built a scalable safety-enhancing application.


Project 3: Age and Emotion Detection for Movie Theatre
1. Introduction
Developed a system to detect age/emotion and restrict entry based on age for theatre audiences, logging emotions.
2. Background
Useful for age-based access, audience analytics, emotion tracking in entertainment venues.
3. Learning Objectives
Face detection, model integration, rule-based filtering, CSV logging, GUI
4. Activities and Tasks Performed
Detected faces → Predicted age and emotion → Applied rules (13–60) → Logged results to CSV
5. Skills and Competencies Acquired
Deep learning integration, OpenCV, rule logic, pandas CSV logging
6. Feedback and Evidence
Accuracy ≥70%, CSV logs confirm successful testing
7. Challenges and Solutions
Handled model file issues, lighting problems, GUI refresh errors
8. Outcomes and Impact
End-to-end modular system with rule-based logic and logging
9. Conclusion
Successfully built a theatre monitoring system using deep learning
